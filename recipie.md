Steps to make the "best" cookies ever.

1. take flour and sugar and baking powder in whatever mesurments you feel like and mix them together.
2. mix chocolate and milk and vanilla extract in a seperate container
3. mix both containers together
4. melt the butter for about 15 seconds or use room temp butter and stick about the entire stick in there or however much you have
5. mix it all together again and try some
6. off of the taste and how it looks add whatever else you feel like adding
7. add some salt for fun
8. add more flour or sugar to make it a more solid mixture
9. place the mixture on a plate in small sections 
10. take the plate and put it in the microwave for about a minute
11. take the plate out and look at it or try it to see if it is cooked
12. repeat steps 10 and 11 until the cookies are cooked
13. once the cookies are "cooked" grab a bunch of icecream and dump it on the cookies so you cannot taste how bad the cookies is, vanilla is preffered for this because it properly covers the "cookies" taste.
14. eat it
